<h5>Activity 2.1: Headings, Paragraphs, and <u> Text Formatting</u></h5>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<p>This paragraph incorporates some of the text formatting styles in HTML. <b>The bold tag is incorporated in this sentence,</b><i> while the italicized tag is used in this section of the sentence.</i> The <tt>monospaced tag</tt> is rarely used in buiding websites; it's usually the <b>bold text, </b><i>italicized, </i> and <u>underlined text</u> that are mostly used.</p>
<hr>
<p>Although this website might look exactly the same, there's a minor difference. First, the <b>br tag </b>was included and it is placed between the two heading tags. Second, the <i>horizontal line </i>was incorporated to create division or sections in the website. <br /> Lastly, an image was embedded in this website. The image has a dimensions of <i>500 x 300 pixels.</i></p>
